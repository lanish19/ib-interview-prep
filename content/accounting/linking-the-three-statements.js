      title="Linking the Three Financial Statements"
      concept="The income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement are interconnected reports that together provide a comprehensive view of a company's financial health."
      explanation="Net income from the income statement flows into retained earnings on the balance sheet and is the starting point for the cash flow statement. Changes in balance sheet accounts affect cash flow through working capital adjustments. Investing and financing activities impact both the cash flow statement and the balance sheet. Understanding these linkages is essential for accurate financial modeling and analysis."
      importance="Mastering the connections between the statements allows analysts to build integrated financial models, trace the impact of transactions, and identify inconsistencies or errors. It is a fundamental skill tested in investment banking interviews and foundational for DCF, M&A, and LBO modeling."
      examples={[
        "Net income increases retained earnings on the balance sheet",
        "Depreciation reduces net income but is added back in cash flow",
        "Inventory purchases increase assets and reduce cash",
        "Debt issuance increases cash and liabilities",
        "Dividends reduce cash and retained earnings",
        "Changes in deferred revenue impact both cash flow and liabilities"
