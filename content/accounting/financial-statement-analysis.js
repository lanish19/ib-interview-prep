        title="Financial Statement Analysis (FSA)"
        concept="Financial statement analysis involves evaluating a company's financial statements to assess its performance, financial health, and valuation potential."
        explanation="FSA combines multiple approaches: horizontal (trend) analysis compares financial data over time; vertical (common-size) analysis expresses items as a percentage of a base figure; ratio analysis evaluates profitability, liquidity, solvency, and efficiency; and cash flow analysis examines cash generation and usage. Together, these techniques provide a comprehensive view of a company's financial position and prospects."
        importance="Mastering FSA is essential for investment bankers to value companies, identify risks, and support deal structuring. It also prepares you to answer technical interview questions confidently."
