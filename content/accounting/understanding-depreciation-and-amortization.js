      title="Understanding Depreciation and Amortization"
      concept="Depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses that allocate the cost of tangible (depreciation) and intangible (amortization) assets over their useful lives."
      explanation="Depreciation applies to physical assets like buildings and equipment, reflecting wear and tear or obsolescence. Amortization applies to intangible assets with finite lives, like patents or copyrights. These expenses reduce net income but are added back in cash flow calculations because they don't involve actual cash outflows. Different methods (straight-line, accelerated) affect the timing of expense recognition."
      importance="Understanding D&A is crucial for accurate financial modeling, valuation (especially EBITDA calculations), and tax analysis. It impacts profitability, asset values, and cash flow projections."
      examples={[
        "Straight-line depreciation of a machine over 10 years",
        "Accelerated depreciation for tax benefits",
        "Amortization of a patent over its legal life",
        "Impact of D&A on EBITDA and free cash flow",
        "Distinguishing D&A from capital expenditures"
